1. Clone this repo or download all files. [maxx-newsletter-mail](https://github.com/gaiusmathew/maxx-newsletter-mail)
2. Run Yarn or NPM from the root folder to install all dependencies.
3. We need to run two Node process to see Sender and Consumer | email data consuming from channel.
4. Make sure to substitute the env variables in .env file
5. Execute the below codes in two different terminals

    ```
    node .							# Run node instance
    node consumer-worker.js       	# Run consumer worker instance
    ```

6. After executing these commands, you can see the status of request made to the queue in terminal 1, first node will be stopped after sending request to queue
7. The second terminal will actively display status of the message received from the queue and mail triggered status
